Developer must acquire the following files to build this project. The best way to do this is to
acquire and build craftbukkit. The best way to do this is using the build tools (https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/).
Build using a command like //java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev <minecraft version>//

 * spigot-api-1.<version>.jar

## Optional
There is a soft dependency on the ManHunt plugin (https://github.com/jchoyt/ManHunt).
It is not required to run, but version 1.2 or later is required to build. Download that and build with //ant jar//
